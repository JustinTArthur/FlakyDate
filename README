FlakyDate is a Django webapp that enables users to adjust the "Upload Date" of photos or sets of photos
in Flickr. Because a user's Photostream is presented in order of upload, this allows a user to organize
their Photostream in the way they see fit. For example, if the beautiful panorama landscape you spent
hours processing, stitching, and HDRing gets drowned out by the "Uncle Billy's Drunken Birthday Fiesta"
set and this makes you sad, use FlakyDate to set Uncle Billy a couple years outside of your Photostream's
page 1.

1. Create a Python environment for this app and Django. If you have virtualenv, just run the following
	in this directory:
virtualenv --no-site-packages --distribute env
(The env directory is ignored in this git repo)

2. Install the Python dependencies into this environment. This project's dependencies are 
	listed in requirements.txt. If your environment is a virtualenv, make sure you've
	activated the virtual environment before installing the dependencies. If you have pip,
	the dependencies are easily installed:
source env/bin/activate #if using a virtualenv
pip install -r requirements.txt
	
3. Create a local_settings.py module and fill in the FLICKR_API_KEY and FLICKR_API_SECRET settings as
well as a CACHE if you don't wish to use the default local memcached setting.

4. Connect up to a web container like Apache httpd and you're set.
